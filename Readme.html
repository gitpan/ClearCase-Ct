<H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS

</A></H1>
This perl module functions as a wrapper for <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG>, allowing the command-line interface of
<STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> to be extended or modified. It allows defaults to be changed, new flags to
be added to existing <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> commands, or entirely new <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> commands to be synthesized.


<P>

Unfortunately, there's no equivalent mechanism for wrapping GUI access to
clearcase.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SUMMARY">SUMMARY

</A></H1>
Here's a quick overview of the extensions available via <STRONG><EM>ct</EM></STRONG> which may be of interest to users:


<P>

Many <EM>cleartool</EM> commands have been enhanced to simulate the standard flags <STRONG>-dir</STRONG>, <STRONG>-rec</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-all</STRONG>, which cause the command to operate on (respectively) all eligible
elements in the current dir, the current dir recursively, and the current
vob. The enhanced commands include
<STRONG>checkin/ci</STRONG>, <STRONG>unco</STRONG>, <STRONG>diff</STRONG>, <STRONG>mkelem</STRONG>, and <STRONG>lsprivate</STRONG>. Thus you can check in all your current checkouts with <STRONG><EM>ct ci -all</EM></STRONG> or see the view-private files in and under the current dir with <STRONG><EM>ct lsprivate
-rec</EM></STRONG>. You can convert a tree of view-private data into elements with
<STRONG><EM>ct mkelem -rec -ci</EM></STRONG>.


<P>

The <STRONG><EM>ct checkin</EM></STRONG> command is also enhanced to take a <STRONG>-diff</STRONG> flag which prints your changes to the screen before prompting for a
comment.


<P>

A new command <STRONG><EM>ct edit</EM></STRONG> is added. This is the same as <STRONG><EM>ct checkout</EM></STRONG>
but execs your favorite editor after checking out. It also takes a
<STRONG>-ci</STRONG> flag which will check the file in afterwards.


<P>

All commands which take a <STRONG>-tag <EM>view-tag</EM></STRONG> option are enhanced to recognize the <STRONG>-me</STRONG> flag. This modifies the effect of <STRONG>-tag</STRONG> by prepending your username to the view name. E.g.  <STRONG>-tag <EM>foo</EM> -me</STRONG> is a shorthand for <STRONG>-tag <EM>&lt;username&gt;_foo</EM></STRONG>. Similarly,
<STRONG><EM>ct lsview -me</EM></STRONG> will show only views whose names match the pattern
<EM>&lt;<STRONG>username</STRONG>&gt;_*</EM>.


<P>

The <STRONG><EM>ct mkview</EM></STRONG> command is enhanced to default the view-storage location to a standard
place using a standard naming convention. See
<EM>SiteProfile.pm.sample</EM> for how this is set up. Also, <STRONG>mkview</STRONG>
recognizes the <STRONG>-me</STRONG> flag as described above. This means that making a new view can/should be
done as <STRONG><EM>ct mkview -tag foo -me</EM></STRONG>.


<P>

New pseudo-commands <STRONG><EM>ct edattr</EM></STRONG> and <STRONG><EM>ct edcmnt</EM></STRONG> are added. These make it easy to edit the attributes and comments,
respectively, of a particular version.


<P>

A new command <STRONG><EM>ct rmpriv</EM></STRONG> is added, which behaves like
<CODE><STRONG>rm -i `ct lsprivate -rec`</STRONG></CODE>, though <STRONG>-dir</STRONG> or <STRONG>-all</STRONG> may be substituted for <STRONG>-rec</STRONG> and <STRONG>-f</STRONG> may be passed to override <STRONG>-i</STRONG>.


<P>

Detailed descriptions of all the above may be found below. Summaries are
available via the standard <STRONG>-h</STRONG> flag.


<P>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_CATCS">CATCS

</A></STRONG>
New <STRONG>-expand</STRONG> flag. This recursively follows all include statements in order to print a
complete config spec.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_CI">CI/CHECKIN

</A></STRONG>
Extended to handle the <STRONG>-dir/-rec/-all</STRONG> flags.


<P>

Extended to allow symbolic links to be ``checked in'' (by simply checking
in the target of the link instead).


<P>

Extended to implement a <STRONG>-diff</STRONG> flag, which runs a <STRONG><EM>ct diff -pred</EM></STRONG>
command before each checkin so the user can look at his/her changes before
typing the comment.


<P>

Also, automatically supplies -nc to checkins if the element list consists
of only directories (directories get a default comment).


<P>

Also extended to implement a <STRONG>-iff</STRONG> flag. This reduces the supplied list of elements to those truly checked
out. E.g. <CODE>ct ct -iff *.c</CODE> will check in only the elements which match *.c <STRONG>and</STRONG> are checked out, without producing a lot of errors for the others.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_CO">CO/CHECKOUT

</A></STRONG>
Extension: if element being checked out is a symbolic link, silently
replace it with the name of its target, because for some reason ClearCase
doesn't do this automatically.


<P>

Automatically defaults checkouts to use -nc. This could be done with
clearcase_profile as well, of course, but is more centralized here.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_EDIT">EDIT

</A></STRONG>
Convenience command. Same as 'checkout' but execs your favorite editor
afterwards. Takes all the same flags as checkout, plus <STRONG>-ci</STRONG> to check the element back in afterwards. When <STRONG>-ci</STRONG> is used in conjunction with
<STRONG>-diff</STRONG> the file will be either checked in or un-checked out depending on whether
it was modified.


<P>

Also, <STRONG><EM>ct edit -dir</EM></STRONG> will not check anything out but will exec the editor on all currently
checked-out files.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_DIFF">DIFF

</A></STRONG>
Modified default: if no flags given, assume -pred.


<P>

Extended to handle the <STRONG>-dir/-rec/-all</STRONG> flags. Also adds a <STRONG>-c</STRONG> flag to generate a context diff (by simply using the real diff program).


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_REVIEW">REVIEW

</A></STRONG>
New convenience command: sends a context diff between current and previous
versions to the 'pprint' program, which prints it with line numbers
appropriate for code reviews. E.g. you could generate a listing of all
changes currently checked-out in your view with <CODE>ct review -all</CODE>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_CITREE">CITREE

</A></STRONG>
New command. Takes a tree of files from normal Unix file space and puts
them under source control in the specified VOB directory. If there are
already elements by the same name, it checks them out and back in.
Otherwise it runs mkelem operations as needed.


<P>

<STRONG>NOTE: by default, <EM>citree</EM> makes the target directory an exact
replica of the source by removing any files from the target which don't
exist in the source</STRONG>. This is not the disaster it might seem since the files are still present
in ClearCase, but in any case the <STRONG><EM>-r</EM></STRONG>
flag will turn this behavior off.


<P>

This is just a wrapper to the standalone <STRONG><EM>citree</EM></STRONG> program written by Paul Smith <A
HREF="MAILTO:(psmith@BayNetworks.com).">(psmith@BayNetworks.com).</A> Run <STRONG><EM>citree</EM></STRONG> with no arguments for full details.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_ECLIPSE">ECLIPSE

</A></STRONG>
New command. <EM>Eclipse</EM>s an element by copying a view-private version over it. This is the
dynamic-view equivalent of ``hijacking'' a file in a snapshot view.
Typically of use if you need temporary write access to a file when the VOB
is locked, or it's checked out reserved.  <STRONG>Eclipsing
elements can lead to dangerous levels of confusion - use with care!</STRONG>




<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_EDATTR">EDATTR

</A></STRONG>
New command, inspired by the <STRONG>edcs</STRONG> cmd. Analogous to <STRONG>edcs</STRONG>,
<STRONG>edattr</STRONG> dumps the attributes of the specified elements into a temp file, then execs
your favorite editor on it, and adds, removes or modifies the attributes as
appropriate after you exit the editor. Attribute types are created and
deleted automatically. This is particularly useful on Unix platforms
because as of CC 3.2 the Unix GUI doesn't support modification of
attributes.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_EDCMNT">EDCMNT

</A></STRONG>
Similar to <STRONG>edattr</STRONG>. For each version specified, dump the comment into a temp file, allow the
user to edit it with his/her favorite editor, then change the version's
comment to the results of the edit. The <STRONG>-new</STRONG>
flag causes it to ignore the previous comment.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_RMPRIV">RMPRIV

</A></STRONG>
New convenience command. Conceptually this is just a shorthand for
<STRONG>"rm -i `ct lsp`"</STRONG>, but it also handles convenience features such as the rm-like <STRONG>-f</STRONG> flag plus <STRONG>-dir/-rec/-all</STRONG>. It has the benefit of behaving the same way on NT as well.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_FIND">FIND

</A></STRONG>
Extended to simulate the -fmt option. This is done by sending the results
of <STRONG>find</STRONG> to a <STRONG>describe -fmt</STRONG>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_LS">LS

</A></STRONG>
On Windows, do the user a favor and handle globbing for DOS shell.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_LSVTREE">LSVTREE

</A></STRONG>
Modified default to always use <STRONG>-a</STRONG> flag.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_LSPRIVATE">LSPRIVATE

</A></STRONG>
Extended to recognize <STRONG>-dir/-rec/-all</STRONG> (underlying lsprivate always behaves in a <STRONG>-all</STRONG> fashion). Also allows a directory to be specified, such that 'ct lsprivate
.' restricts output to cwd.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_LSVIEW">LSVIEW

</A></STRONG>
Extended to recognize the general <STRONG>-me</STRONG> flag, restricting the search namespace to &lt;<STRONG>username</STRONG>&gt;_*.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_MKATTYPE">MKATTYPE

</A></STRONG>
Modification: if user tries to make a type in the current VOB without
explicitly specifying -ordinary or -global, and if said VOB is associated
with an admin VOB, then by default create the type as a global type in the
admin VOB instead. <STRONG><EM>In effect, this makes -global
the default iff a suitable admin VOB exists</EM></STRONG>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_MKBRTYPE">MKBRTYPE,MKLBTYPE

</A></STRONG>
Same as mkattype above.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_MKELEM">MKELEM

</A></STRONG>
Extended to handle the <STRONG>-dir/-rec</STRONG> flags, enabling automated mkelems with otherwise the same syntax as
original. Directories are also automatically checked out as required in
this mode. <STRONG>Note that this
automatic directory checkout is only enabled when the candidate list is
derived via the <CODE>-dir/-rec</CODE> flags</STRONG>. If the <STRONG>-ci</STRONG> flag is present, any directories automatically checked out are checked back
in too.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_MKVIEW">MKVIEW

</A></STRONG>
Extended in the following ways:


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_New_me_flag"> New -me flag

</A></STRONG>
Supports the <EM>-me</EM> flag to prepend <CODE>$LOGNAME</CODE> to the view name, separated by an
underscore. This enables the convention that all user views be named <STRONG>&lt;username&gt;_&lt;whatever&gt;</STRONG>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Default_view_storage_location"> Default view-storage location

</A></STRONG>
Provides a standard default view-storage path which includes the user's
name. Thus a user can simply type <STRONG>"mkview -me -tag foo"</STRONG> and the view will be created as &lt;username&gt;_foo with the view storage placed in a default location determined by the
sysadmin.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_New_profile_flag"> New -profile flag

</A></STRONG>
The user can associate the view with a <EM>ClearCase View Profile</EM>. Although, as of CC 3.2 these can only be manipulated on Windows NT, this
extension allows them to be <EM>used</EM> on Unix platforms. In order for this to work, the view-profile storage area
must be accessible to the Unix platforms (via NFS or Samba, for instance).
The profile text is modified to replace backslashes with forward slashes,
correct line-termination characters, and is then instantiated in the config
spec. The <STRONG><EM>ct synccs</EM></STRONG> command can be used to resync.


<P>

#=item 4. New <EM>-back</EM> flag #This is an advanced topic ...


<P>

## Note: to use the default view-storage feature you must define ## the
variable <CODE>$ViewStgRoot</CODE> to the appropriate place, typically ##
/net/somewhere/viewstore/... or similar.


<P>

</OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_SYNCCS">SYNCCS

</A></STRONG>
New command: takes an optional view tag via <STRONG>-tag</STRONG> and a view-profile name with <STRONG>-profile</STRONG>, and synchronizes the config spec with the profile. If no tag is passed,
operates on the current view spec; if no
<STRONG>-profile</STRONG>, re-synchronizes with the current profile.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_UNCO">UNCO

</A></STRONG>
Modified default to always use -rm (this may be controversial but is easily
overridden in the user's profile).


<P>

Extended to accept (and ignore) the <STRONG>-nc</STRONG> flag for consistency with other cleartool cmds.


<P>

Extended to handle the -dir/-rec/-all flags.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_SETVIEW">SETVIEW/STARTVIEW/ENDVIEW

</A></STRONG>
Extended to support the <STRONG>-me</STRONG> flag (prepends &lt;<STRONG>username</STRONG>&gt;_* to tag).


<P>

</UL>

<H1><A NAME="FURTHER_CUSTOMIZATION">FURTHER CUSTOMIZATION

</A></H1>
Working on a profile is actually quite easy if you remember that within it <STRONG>$_</STRONG> is set to the command name, <STRONG>@ARGV</STRONG> is the complete command line and <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is a copy of it, <STRONG>$0</STRONG> is the path to the wrapper, and
<STRONG>$ClearCmd</STRONG> is the path to the real <EM>cleartool</EM> program. Also, the hash <STRONG>%Vgra</STRONG> is a reverse lookup such that <CODE><EM>$ARGV[$Vgra{xyz}] eq "xyz"</EM></CODE>.


<P>

With most perl modules, the <CODE>.pm</CODE> code itself (the part that gets found via <CODE>@INC</CODE>) is static - it's not generally modified except via updates of the module.
Meanwhile, users write code to use the module and that code is fluid; they
change it as they please. This module is backwards from that since the <EM>ct</EM> program is policy-free and thus shouldn't need to be changed significantly.
Meanwhile, the
<STRONG>Profile.pm</STRONG> is intended to be a reflection of the local policies and preferences; the
provided <STRONG>Profile.pm</STRONG> is simply a sample of what can be done.


<P>

The <STRONG>Profile.pm</STRONG> does <STRONG>not</STRONG> establish a separate namespace; it operates within <CODE>main::</CODE>. There did not seem to be any good reason to do so, since the whole point
is to operate directly on the namespace provided by the client program <EM>ct</EM>.


<P>

The <EM>ct</EM> program is normally expected to be used under that name, which means that
users running <STRONG>cleartool lsco</STRONG>, for instance, will go around the wrapper. However, it's also designed to
allow for complete wrapping if desired. To do so, move <CODE>$ATRIAHOME/bin/cleartool</CODE> to
<CODE>$ATRIAHOME/bin/wrapped/cleartool</CODE> and install <EM>ct</EM> as
<CODE>$ATRIAHOME/bin/cleartool</CODE>. You can continue to install/link the wrapper as <EM>ct</EM> as well - it won't invoke the wrapper twice because it contains code to
detect the presence of the moved-aside binary and run it.


<P>

As a safety mechanism, the <CODE>require</CODE>-ing of the profile is handled within an <CODE>eval</CODE> block, so a syntax error or config problem in the profile won't cause it to
fail. It will simply print a warning and continue.
