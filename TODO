Brad Appleton has suggested that the native Perl syntax used for the
~/.ct_profile.pl is too complex for the average user, and has described
a method he's had some success for using a simpler syntax without a
large speed penalty. I may get around to at least analyzing his
suggestion and maybe even implementing it at some point.
