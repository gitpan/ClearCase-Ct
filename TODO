=> Brad Appleton has suggested that the native Perl syntax used for the
   ~/.ct_profile.pl is too complex for the average user, and has described
   a method he's had some success with for using a simpler syntax without
   a large speed penalty. I may get around to at least analyzing his
   suggestion and maybe even implementing it at some point. Unfortunately
   it relies on Data::Dumper which isn't standard until 5.005 so there may
   be useability implications.

=> It would be nice to implement Unix snapshot views (e.g.
   'ct mkview -snapshot' and 'ct update') through this interface.
   Presumably there are Perl solutions out there now to implement some
   variant of snapshot views; if I can get hold of one I might wire it in.

=> Rewrite based on a Getopt::Argv type of object?
